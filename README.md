# Pipe

### Description
This is a project in Yingcai Program. I used python to write a game called Pipe. The rule is that players can switch the pipe in a block, and the goal is to make the pipes connected. 

My study mainly focused on how to design the algorithm that generates the random initial state in the game. A google drive link to the essay(in Chinese): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuuDbxnas8ZzbOVfCF2eyUM17-02Lfuh/view?usp=sharing. 

### Run the game:
You can download the files and click pipe.exe to run the game.
